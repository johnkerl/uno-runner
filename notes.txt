To examine:
* Expected next-turn hand size conditioned on current hand size.  Try to
  explain long-term game-length variability in terms of short-term hand-size
  pressures.
* Distribution of hand sizes overall; then, conditioned on game length (or,
  more coarsely, number of reshuffles).
* Distribution of game lengths (in number of turns, and/or number of
  reshuffles).
* Distribution of draw sizes.
