This is a little Java simulator for the card game Uno, for investigating
fat-tailedness of game-length and other distributions.  It will become grist
for an upcoming blog post at exegetotrope.blogspot.com.  It's also an example
of my use of Java:  I use Java quite a bit on the job but (until now) didn't
have any examples of that on Github.
